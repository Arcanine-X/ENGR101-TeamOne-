Week of 16 May review:
This week we didn't completed all of the tasks which we hoped to. This is bcause we wern't able to test the line following code due to the hardware still being assebled. However, on the hardware side everything is completed besides some of the aethetics which isn't a prioirty at the moment. Something that we did test was the gate opening, which is working 100% as it should. Most of the software checklist will be pushed to next week as that is now the main focus. We are currently behind schedule but in the next week we should be able to make some fast progress.
