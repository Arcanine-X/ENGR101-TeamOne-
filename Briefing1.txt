Plan: Deadlines/goals will be broad & explorative until week 3, as we all grow familiar with the challenge & enjoy breaks. Ideal phase 
for creativity & big goals.

Milestones

Week:
1) Plan entirely complete, general foundation-work (github, contact swapping, etc.) - team goals/methodology/roles/etc.
2) Thinking, Concepts, Brainstorming - large scope for this, any and all ideas welcome
3) Prototypes and demos, finalizing hardware - bringing most promising concepts into reality, refining ideas, etc.

General mindset:
Software goals will be planned out cohesively in advance, as most members are more comfortable in this area. Hardware can then fit around
these dates (with adjustments for lenience) - eg. custom chassis unneeded until after week 3, as initial goals/quadrants can be completed
without.

We want a basic template ASAP before we do anything, so the code-base knows what it's working with.

Quadrant requirements:
First quadrant: send a signal, follow a line
Second quadrant: further line following (curved)
Third quadrant: navigate through dummy-lines to goal
Fourth quadrant: navigate maze (turning/banking/reversing in limited space, etc.)

Hardware limitations:
All hardware must be from class, purchased with a budget of Arthur$, or 3D-printed (after design in CAD). Limitation on 3D printing.

Note: Patrick shall be sternly questioned regarding his absence and commitment to this project he doesn't yet know we've begun.
