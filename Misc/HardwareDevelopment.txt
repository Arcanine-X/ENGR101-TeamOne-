###Hardware Development

##Concepting

 - Wheels centralised
 - Camera angle 45 degrees
 - Pi & battery centred over wheels
 - Short sensors angled at 45 degrees
 - Medium sensor beneath camera facing ahead
 - Pi fixed horizontally
 - Made from bamboo (sustainable/recyclable)
 
##Development

 - Wheels nearer to front to minimise data lost when turning
 - Camera angled and positioned so the bottom line of pixels is as close to the axle line as possible
 - Camera must be high enough so the top several lines of pixels are 20cm away from the wheels
 - Short range sensors too short range, swap to medium range
 - Medium range sensor too short range to detect wall, change method to camera (wall/floor color change identification)
 - Rear wheel height must be accounted for for camera angle
 - New rear wheel must be used to minimise friction
 - Pi to be held vertically above the battery as near the front axle as possible
 - Chassis base plate to be replaced with custom version
 - Bamboo no longer used unless time permits
